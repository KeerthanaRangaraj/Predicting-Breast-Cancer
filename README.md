# Predicting-Breast-Cancer

## Aim and Objective of Study
This analysis aims to observe which features are 
most helpful in predicting malignant or benign 
cancer and to see general trends that may aid us 
in model selection and hyperparameter
selection. The goal is to classify whether breast 
cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this,
we have used machine learning classification 
methods (Logistic and Decision Tree) to fit a 
function that can predict the discrete class of 
new input.
The specific objective of the study:
• Employing machine learning to 
differentiate whether it’s a benign or
malignant form of breast cancer.
• Detect breast cancer at the early 
stages using machine learning
techniques.
• Avoid human errors during breast 
cancer classification with the help of 
machine-learning systems
